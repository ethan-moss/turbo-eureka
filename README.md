# turbo-eureka

Quick trial of `govukhugo` - is a theme for the Hugo static site builder that is based on the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

All credit goes [to co-analysis team](https://github.com/co-analysis/govukhugo) for the build and development work. This repo does not build off or add to this work in any way.

This repo is purely exploratory, is trialling `govhugouk` and contains no real data/information.
